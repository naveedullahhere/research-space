                            <li>Writing Space acts as an agent for qualified experts to sell original work to their customers.</li>
                            <li>The Customer engages Writing Space (the "Agency") to locate an expert (the "Principal") in order to
                                carry out research and/or assessment services (the "Work") for the Customer during the term of the agreement in
                                accordance with these provisions.</li>
                            <li>The Principal authorises the Agency to process various actions under this agreement on their behalf.</li>
                            <li>The Agency is entitled to refuse any order at their discretion and in such cases will refund any payment made
                                by the Customer in respect of that order.</li>
                            <li>The prices and delivery times quoted on the Agency's website are illustrative. If an alternative price and/or
                                delivery time offered to the Customer is unacceptable, the Agency will refund any payment made by the Customer
                                in respect of that order.</li>

                            <li>The appointment agreement between the Customer and the Agency (collectively the "Parties") shall commence once
                                the Agency have received payment for the order and allocated the order to the Principal ("the Commencement
                                Date").</li>
                            <li>The Agreement will continue between the Parties until the time period allowed for amendments has expired,

                        <ol>
                            <li>In order to provide research and/or assessment services to fulfil the Customer's Order, the Agency will
                                allocate a suitably qualified expert which it deems to hold appropriate levels of qualification and experience
                                to undertake the Customer's Order.</li>
                            <li>The Agency undertakes to exercise all reasonable skill and judgement in allocating a suitable expert, having
                                regard to the available experts' qualifications, experience and quality record with us, and to any available
                                information the Agency has about the Customer's degree or course.</li>
                            <li>Once the Agency has allocated an order to the Expert, the Customer acknowledges that the Order is binding and
                                cannot be cancelled.</li>
                            <li>If the Agency has accepted a deposit from the Customer, the Customer agrees that the balance outstanding will
                                be paid to the Agency at least 24 hours prior to the date on which their Order is due. If the full balance
                                outstanding is not paid to the Agency in accordance with this term, a delay in the delivery of the Customer's
                                Work may result.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Co-operation</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Customer will give the Agency clear briefings and ensure that all the facts given about the Order are
                                accurate.</li>
                            <li>The Agency will co-operate fully with the Customer and use reasonable care and skill to make the Order
                                provided as successful as is to be expected from a competent research agency. The Customer will help the Agency
                                do this by making available to the Agency all relevant information at the beginning of the transaction and
                                co-operating with the Agency throughout the transaction should the Principal require any further information or
                                guidance.</li>
                            <li>The Customer acknowledges that failure to provide such information or guidance during the course of the
                                transaction may delay the delivery of their Work, and that the Agency will not be held responsible for any loss
                                or damage caused as a result of such delay. In such cases, the 'Completion on Time Promise' will not apply.</li>

                        <h4>Approvals and Authority</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Where the Principal or the Agency requires confirmation of any particular detail they will contact the
                                Customer using the email address or telephone number provided by the Customer.</li>
                            <li>The Customer acknowledges that the Agency may accept instructions received using these modes of contact and
                                may reasonably assume that those instructions are generated from the Customer.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Personal Information and Data Protection</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Agency undertakes to collect, hold and use all data provided by the Customer and the Principal in
                                accordance with obligations under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (Reg
                                EU 2016/679) ("GDPR"). </li>
                            <li>The Agency is the data controller for the purposes of GDPR in relation to any data shared between the Customer
                                and Principal and the Agency assumes all responsibilities and obligations related with the role of data
                                controller.</li>
                            <li>The Principal is a data processor for the purposes of GDPR in relation to any Customer data shared with them
                                and assumes all responsibilities and obligations related to the role of a data processor.</li>
                            <li>Personal data is obtained, held and processed for the purposes of processing payments, processing Orders at
                                all stages and communications that are opted into.</li>
                            <li>The Agency operates a privacy policy which is available on the Agency's websites and a copy can be provided on
                                request.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Changes to Work in Progress</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Customer may request changes to their Order specification after the Order has been assigned to an expert,
                                but these changes are subject to agreement with the Principal. Requests for changes to the Order specification
                                are not confirmed unless, and until, they have been agreed to by the Principal.</li>
                            <li>The Customer may provide the Principal with additional supporting information shortly after the Commencement
                                Date, provided that this does not add to or conflict with the details contained in their original Order
                                specification.</li>
                            <li>If the Customer provides additional information or instruction after an order has been allocated to the
                                Principal, and this does conflict with the details contained in the original Order specification, the Principal
                                may request an additional cost to cover any extra time needed to adapt to the new Order specifications. Any
                                additional costs will be negotiated on behalf of the Principal by the Agency and the Customer can choose whether
                                to proceed with the change to the Order specification for the final quoted cost. The Customer understands that
                                this may result in a delay in the delivery of their Work for which the Principal/Agency will not be held
                                responsible.</li>
                            <li>In instances where a change in Order specification takes place during the progress of an Order, the delivery
                                date may be changed at the discretion of the Agency on behalf of the Principal. Any change in the delivery date
                                will be reasonable and based on all the circumstances. Under these circumstances, the 'Completion on Time'
                                Promise will not be payable.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Amendments to Completed Orders</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Agency agrees that if the Customer believes that their completed Work does not meet the Order
                                specification and/or the promises of the Principal as set out on the Agency website, the Customer may request
                                amendments to the Work within 7 days of the delivery date, or longer if they have specifically paid to extend
                                the amendments period. Such amendments will be made free of charge to the Customer.</li>
                            <li>The Customer is permitted to make one request, via the Customer Control Panel, containing all details of the
                                required amendments. This will be sent to the Principal for comment. </li>
                            <li>If the Principal does not agree with the Customer's request, they will be given the opportunity to comment on
                                it. In the event that agreement cannot be reached between Principal and Customer regarding the amendments, the
                                Agency will assess the dispute and their decision will be final. They may, at their discretion, refer the matter
                                to a different expert for assessment, in which case the decision of that expert will be binding on both parties.
                            </li>
                            <li>If the Principal fails to comply fully with the Customer's reasonable request for amendments, the Customer is
                                permitted to request again that the Work is amended until the request has been fully dealt with.</li>
                            <li>If the request to amend the Work falls outside of the time allowed for amendments, or if the Customer asks for
                                amendments that do not relate to their original Order specification, the Principal at their discretion may offer
                                a quote for the completion of the changes or additional work, and the Customer may choose whether or not to
                                accept this. The Customer acknowledges that they may be required to make payment for such changes prior to the
                                additional work being commenced.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Fees</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Agency's commission charges for their services, the Principal's charges for their services and charges for
                                VAT are shown as an aggregate amount on the Agency's website.</li>
                            <li>If the Customer should require their Work to be amended in such a way that is inconsistent with their original
                                Order specification, such amendments will be put to the Principal, who may set their own rate for completing
                                them and the Agency's fee will then be calculated proportionate to that fee.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Value Added Tax</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>VAT is included in the prices quoted by the Agency, where appropriate, at the rate prevailing from time to
                                time.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Terms of Payment</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unless payment is taken at the time of placing an order, once the Agency has found a suitably qualified and
                                experienced expert to undertake the Customer's order, they will contact the Customer by email to take payment.
                            </li>
                            <li>If, at their discretion, the Agency accepts a deposit rather than the full value of the Order, the Customer
                                acknowledges that the full balance will remain outstanding at all times and will be paid to the Agency before
                                the delivery date for the Work.</li>
                            <li>The Customer agrees that once an Order is paid for then the expert allocated by the Agency begins work on that
                                Order, and that the Order may not be cancelled or refunded. Until payment or a deposit has been made and the
                                Order has been allocated to an expert, the Customer may choose to continue with the Order or to cancel the Order
                                at any time.</li>
                            <li>The Customer agrees to be bound by the Agency's refund policies and acknowledges that due to the highly
                                specialised and individual nature of the services that full refunds will only be given in the circumstances
                                outlined in these terms, or other circumstances that occur, in which event any refund or discount is given at
                                the discretion of the Agency.</li>
                            <li>Visa or MasterCard debit and credit cards in USD &amp; GBP will be accepted for payment</li>
                            <li>We will not trade with or provide any services to OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) and sanctioned countries in accordance with the law of UAE</li>

                            <li>The Customer acknowledges that where payment has been made in advance of securing an expert, the Agency cannot
                                guarantee that they will secure a suitable available expert to complete the Work.</li>
                            <li>In the event that the Customer makes a payment in advance and the Agency cannot secure an expert to complete
                                the Work, the Agency will offer the Customer a full refund of the payment made in advance.</li>

                            <li>The Customer acquires an exclusive licence, by assignment by the Principal, to own a copy of the Work for
                                academic purposes to use as an example/model answer. The Customer does not acquire the copyright or the rights
                                to submit the Work, in whole, or in part, as their own. In addition, the Customer undertakes not to carry out
                                any unauthorised distribution, display, or resale of the Work and the Customer agrees to handle the Work in a
                                way that fully respects the fact that the Customer does not hold the copyright to the Work.</li>
                            <li>The Customer is not permitted to pass the Work off as their own, as they do not hold the copyright to the Work
                                and this is a violation of the terms of use.</li>
                            <li>The Agency displays the Fair Use Policy on its website and the Customer agrees to read, understand and follow

                            <li>The Customer agrees that if they hand in the Work supplied by the Principal as their own, either in whole or
                                in part, that they are in breach of copyright and that they will automatically forfeit all of their rights under
                                these terms and conditions. Any further remedy following such instances is entirely at the discretion of the

                                and that the Agency reserves the right to refuse supply of services to those suspected of such behaviour. The
                                Customer accepts that the Agency offers a service that locates suitably qualified experts for the provision of
                                independent personalised research services in order to help students learn and to advance educational standards.

                                website or essay bank after it has been completed. The Principal agrees to never publish, resell, share or
                                otherwise redistribute any Work that has been submitted and/or sold through the Agency.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The Agency is authorised by the Principal to investigate, process and adjudicate refund requests under the
                                main Promises detailed at Clauses 16-18 of this agreement.</li>
                            <li>The Agency is authorised by the Principal to investigate, process and adjudicate refund requests for any other
                                reason for which the Customer feels that the Principal has not met their obligations under this agreement and as
                                part of the Order specifications.</li>
                            <li>The Agency undertakes to process such requests in compliance with existing consumer protection legislation and
                                contractual principles. The Agency undertakes to reach a fair resolution in all circumstances, taking into
                                account fairness to both the Customer and the Principal.</li>
                            <li>If the Agency agrees to refund the Customer in full or part, this refund will be made using the credit or
                                debit card that the Customer used to make their payment initially. If no such card was used (for example, where
                                the Customer deposited the fee directly into the Agency's bank account) the Agency will offer the Customer a
                                choice of refund via bank transfer or credit towards a future order. All refunds are made at the discretion of
                                the Agency.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The Agency agrees to facilitate delivery of all Work before midnight on the due date, unless the due date
                                falls on a Bank Holiday, Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day ("a Non-Working Day"), in which case the
                                Work will be delivered the following day before midnight.</li>
                            <li>On occasion, the Agency may deem further days to be Non-Working Days for the purposes of 16.1 above. These
                                will be communicated by placing a notice on the service website.</li>
                            <li>The Agency undertakes that all Work will be completed by the Principal on time or they will refund the
                                Customer's money in full and deliver their Work for free.</li>
                            <li>The relevant due date for the purposes of this promise is the Customer due date that is set on the Order. This
                                is initially set when the Order is allocated to the Principal.</li>
                            <li>Where a variation to the relevant due date is agreed between the Agency and the Customer, the Completion on
                                Time Promise applies to the rearranged Customer due date.</li>
                            <li>The Agency will not be held liable under this promise for any lateness due to technical problems that may
                                arise due to third parties or otherwise, including, but not limited to issues caused by Internet Service
                                Providers, Mail Account Providers, Database Software, Incompatible Formats and Hosting Providers.</li>
                            <li>The Agency undertakes that if such technical problems occur with a system that they are directly responsible
                                for or that third party contractors provide them with, then they will on request provide reasonable proof of
                                these technical problems, so far as such proof is available, or will otherwise honour their Completion On Time
                                Promise in full.</li>
                            <li>The Agency is not liable under this promise where any delay is caused by the death or illness of the Principal
                                or their immediate family.</li>
                            <li>If the Customer does not receive their Work on the due date, they agree to contact the Agency through the
                                Customer Control Panel the next day (or the next day after a Non-Working Day) to work with them to overcome the
                                technical difficulties. A representative will then assist them on the phone or through the Customer Control
                                Panel until they are able to receive the Work. The Agency will provide proof upon request, where available, of
                                any technical difficulties, death or illness.</li>
                            <li>If the Customer decides to wait longer to inform the Agency of non-delivery, they agree that they do so at
                                their own risk and that the Agency will not be held liable for any delay of the Customer to contact them about
                                non- or late delivery. If requested, the Agency will provide proof that either the Work was completed by the
                                Principal on time and uploaded, or that the Work was made available to the Customer on time, or proof that
                                technical difficulties, death or illness prevented the Work being available on time. If the Agency is able to
                                prove at least one of these then the Customer will not be entitled to any refund or discount; otherwise, if the
                                Agency cannot prove at least one of these occurrences, the Customer will receive a full refund and their Work
                                for free. The Customer agrees that they cannot seek any other recourse to a refund for delivery problems.</li>
                            <li>The Agency will have no obligations whatsoever in relation to the Completion on Time Promise if the delay in
                                the delivery of the Work is as a result of the Customer's actions - including but not limited to where the
                                Customer has failed to pay an outstanding balance due in relation to the Order, sent in extra information after
                                the order has started or changed any elements of the order instructions. Delays on the part of the Customer may
                                result in the relevant due date being changed according to the extent of the delay without activating the
                                Completion On Time Promise.</li>
                            <li>Where the Customer has agreed with the Principal for 'staggered delivery', the Completion on Time Promise
                                relates to the final delivery date of the Work and not to the delivery of individual components of the Work.

                            <li>Where the Customer detects serious or substantial plagiarism in the Work, the Principal will pay the Customer
                                the sum of £5,000.</li>

                                reference to a qualified expert where they deem it necessary to do so. In such circumstances, the Agency's
                                decision will be final.</li>
                            <li>In all cases, no finding of Plagiarism will be made where the Customer has specifically requested that the
                                Principal incorporate material in a way that the Agency would otherwise deem to be Plagiarism.</li>
                            <li>In all cases, where the alleged Plagiarism is minor, or it is reasonably obvious that the alleged Plagiarism
                                is as a result of a mistake, the £5,000 No Plagiarism Promise will not be payable.</li>
                            <li>Where the Principal contends that the alleged Plagiarism is as a result of a mistake, the Agency will
                                carefully review the Work and make a decision, having regard to all relevant circumstances and the Principal's
                                history with the Agency, and make reference to a qualified expert where they deem it necessary to do so. In such
                                circumstances, the Agency's decision as to whether the promise is payable or not will be final.</li>
                            <li>The promise will not apply in circumstances where the Agency detects plagiarism and contacts the Customer to
                                inform them of this, in advance of the Customer contacting the Agency about that plagiarism. In such
                                circumstances, a rewrite will be provided where requested by the Customer.</li>
                            <li>The Agency agrees that if a Principal is responsible for a confirmed Plagiarism offence who fails to award the
                                £5,000 compensation, then they will provide all reasonable assistance to the Customer including the
                                provision of a copy of the Principal's contract with the Agency, and the Principal's name and address, for the
                                Customer to bring a remedial action directly. The Agency is not responsible for reimbursing the Customer with
                                the £5,000 compensation. However, if the plagiarism bond becomes payable and the Agency holds sums that
                                are due to the Principal, the Agency undertakes to retain those funds until the Principal has paid the Customer
                                the plagiarism bond or, if this is not forthcoming, to release those funds (up to the value of the plagiarism
                                bond) to the Customer after a reasonable period of time and on reasonable notice to the Principal. If the Agency
                                is subsequently involved in litigation as a result of holding these funds, it reserves the right to pay these
                                into Court.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The Level Requested Promise applies where the Principal's final Work does not meet the ordered grade, in which

                                will be the difference between the order cost paid and the cost that the order would have been if ordered at the
                                grade the completed Work is deemed to be.</li>
                            <li>This promise is effective for 3 calendar months from the Customer due date agreed for the order.</li>
                            <li>For orders placed at Upper 1st level, the Work is guaranteed to 1st standard only. If the Work is determined
                                to be at 1st class level, no refund is due.</li>
                            <li>Where the Customer wishes to dispute the quality standard of the Work under this promise, they must provide
                                the Agency with credible evidence. Where this is based on the result achieved for the assignment, we require a
                                copy of tutor feedback, proof of grade achieved and a copy of the work submitted. Where this is not based on an
                                official result achieved, the Customer must provide reasons and justification that are capable of being
                                evaluated and reviewed to determine entitlement to a refund under this promise. </li>
                            <li>A complaint must be raised and substantiated within 3 calendar months of the delivery date agreed for the
                                order in order to be eligible for a refund. Complaints received after that date has passed, but found to be
                                valid, may be entitled to a credit voucher of up to a maximum of two thirds of the order value.</li>
                            <li>All supporting evidence supplied in relation to a refund claim will be carefully reviewed and assessed by the
                                Agency, having regard to all relevant circumstances and making reference to a qualified expert where they deem
                                it necessary to do so.</li>
                            <li>If the Customer has in their possession any evidence whatsoever that the Work does not meet the quality
                                standard ordered, it is a condition of this agreement that such evidence must be submitted to the Agency
                                promptly and the Agency will take this evidence into account when reaching a decision. All such evidence will be
                                treated with absolute confidentiality.</li>
                            <li>If the Work is determined to be below the quality standard ordered but the reason for this is that the
                                Customer made requests in their Order specification, including correspondence and amendment requests, that had
                                the effect of lowering the quality standard of the Work, and had these requests not been complied with by the
                                Principal it is likely, on a balance of probabilities, that the Work would have met the required quality
                                standard, no refund is due.</li>
                            <li>If the Work is determined to be below the quality standard ordered, but the reason for this is that the
                                Customer made requests in their Order specification that were open to interpretation or ambiguity, then no
                                refund is due.</li>
                            <li>If the Work is determined to be below the quality standard ordered in light of the course, module or
                                assignment instructions, but the reason for this is that the Customer's order instructions were incomplete or in
                                any way different from their full requirements for the assignment, no refund is due.</li>
                            <li>In all cases, the Agency's decision is final but the Agency will provide the Customer with sufficiently
                                detailed information as to how it reached its decision, including, if applicable, a copy of any expert's report
                                that has been commissioned.</li>
